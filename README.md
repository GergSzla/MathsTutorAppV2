# Maths Tutor Application
The Maths Tutor Application aims to help people with mathematics problems. Through this application, the user has the ability to create themselves a challenge or do an existing challenge. Each challenge contains 10 questions.

The scores of each challenge/session is recorded by the application and can be viewed and reset by the user.
